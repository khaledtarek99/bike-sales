### Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply download the Excel workbook file and open it in Microsoft Excel. The file contains multiple worksheets, each containing analysis and insights on the bike sales data.

* Checked for misspellings and corrected them
* Checked for duplicates and removed them
* Checked for empty rows and removed them

* augmented data by crating new feature (Age Ranges)
## Analysis Conducted
* used descriptive statistics to caculate Customers Average Income, Customers Average Age, and the total sales figures
* Grouped the data by Gender and Purchase Behavior and calculated the average income of customers
* Grouped the data by commute distance and Purchase Behavior and calculated the count of sales figure for each distance range
* Grouped the data by Age Ranges and Purchase Behavior and calculated the count of sales figure for each Age range
* Grouped the data by region and calculated the total sales figures for each region

## Insights Gained
The bike sales dataset was visualized to provide a clear representation of the insights gained from the analysis. The visualizations include Column charts, pie charts, and line graphs in a Dashboard.
* The Customers Average Income = $ 56,360
* The Customers Average Age = 44 years old
* The total sales figures = 481 Bikes
* Male Customers who bought bikes or not had higher average income 
* Customers with a commute distance of 0-1 miles had the highest sales figures
* The age Range with the highest sales figures was 31-54 (Middle Age)
* The sales figures for North America were the highest, followed by Europe and the Pacific region
These insights can be used to optimize the bike manufacturing company's marketing strategy, such as targeting Male customers or focusing on regions with high sales figures.
